# Frozen Lake Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on solving the **Frozen Lake environment** using reinforcement learning techniques. The environment is a classic problem in OpenAI's Gym, where the agent must navigate across a grid of ice to reach a goal while avoiding slipping into holes.

The **Frozen Lake** environment is often used to demonstrate dynamic programming methods like **Value Iteration** and **Q-Learning** in reinforcement learning.

## Files in the Repository

- **Frozen_Lake_anaconda_AI.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the implementation of the Frozen Lake project, including the environment setup, algorithm explanation, and results.

## Objective

The objective of the agent is to find the optimal policy for navigating across the frozen lake to the goal, while avoiding the holes and handling the slippery nature of the environment. The project explores different strategies to solve the environment effectively.

## Environment Details

- **Environment**: Frozen Lake (OpenAI Gym)
- **Grid Size**: 4x4
- **Rewards**: The agent gets a reward of `+1` for reaching the goal, and `0` for falling into a hole or stepping on a frozen block.

## Methods Used

The notebook explores the following techniques:
- **Q-Learning**: A model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that uses Q-values to learn the optimal policy through trial and error.
- **Value Iteration**: A dynamic programming approach to find the optimal policy by iteratively updating the value of each state.

## Libraries and Dependencies

To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `gym`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
  
You can install these libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy gym matplotlib seaborn
```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/frozen-lake.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd frozen-lake
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Frozen_Lake_anaconda_AI.ipynb
   ```
4. Run all cells in the notebook to see the implementation and results.

## Results

- The project demonstrates how the agent learns an optimal policy over time using Q-Learning.
- You can visualize the training process and how the agent improves its performance on the Frozen Lake environment.
